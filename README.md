# Quadcopter motion planning stack
In this project a RRT* path planning and minimum snap trajectory generation (motion planning) stack is implemented for the 3D navigation of a DJI Tello Edu quadcopter in simulation (in blender) and is then tested on real quadcopter via NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Additionally a cascaded PID controller gains for position and velocity control are tuned to follow the generated trajectory. 
(Check the full problem statements here [project2a](https://rbe549.github.io/rbe595/fall2023/proj/p2a/) and [project2b](https://rbe549.github.io/rbe595/fall2023/proj/p2b/))
## Steps to run the code
- This code is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 system
- Install Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, blender python, pyquaternion, djitellopy libraries before running the code.
- To run the simulation:
	-  open the `main.blend` file in blender
	- Go to compositing and set appropriate path to `outputs` folder
   	- Go to scripting tab and load the `main.py` file
   	- In `main.py` choose a map from the given set of four sample maps and uncomment the code accordingly to set start and goal locations for each map.
   	- Run the script in blender.
   	- Once the script is run press `spacebar` to run the simulation in layout tab.
- To run on real quadcopter
	- Set up the tello drone and orin nano
   	- On orin nano clone this repository
   	- Copy the trajectory csv file generated in the previous simulation from `sample_traj` folder to `src` folder
   	- Open the `tello_run.py' file and set the appropriate trajectory file name.
   	- Connect to the network of the tello drone and run in `src' folder the following command:
   	  ```
	  python3 tello_run.py
	  ```
